Hi there, in this project spring boot is used to create an inventory app.

H2 in memory database has been used.

There are 3 rest apis created for these 3 actions which are -> create items in an inventory, get all items from the inventory
and finally get item by name from the inventory!

Also, there are classes in the model package to support dto (Data Transfer Object), response, etc. in this project app.

Some annotation have been used in this spring boot project these are: - @Autowired, @Component, @Repository, @RestController
@RequestMapping, etc. these annotations are used to reduce the boiler-plate code in java (spring boot). Which made this project simpler
and more, easier to read and understand.

I will share postman collection in json format, along with this project setup!

I hope you enjoy this project while testing and running this in your own system.
